There are two ways to create a BIG heading:
# This is a Big Heading

## This is a Sub-heading

Paragraphs are just a bunch of sentences separated
by a blank line. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
adipiscing elit. Nullam.
See, this is another paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit
amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam.
Sometimes, you want to force a line break. In this case,
put two spaces at the end of a line
and do you see the line break?
You can add a horizontal rule like this:
---
You can also set the font on text. For example,
_these words are italicized_,
on some systems *these worlds might be italicized*,
**these words are bolded**,
and finally, `the words use a monospace font`.
You can have bulleted lists:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
  You also can have numbered lists:
1. HTML
   1-16
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
   You can add links. For more information, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma

   If you want to add formatted code to markdown, use backticks before and after it like t
   his:
```
<!DOCTYLE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- body markup goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```
And to add an image, try this:
